We had some time before work began on our final project, so we saw the hackathon as the perfect opportunity to challenge ourselves in a fast-paced, collaborative environment. With a weekend to build something from scratch, we focused on designing an immersive escape room experience in Unity.\n\nEscapeVRoom is a single-level escape room filled with interactive items, environmental puzzles, and game scripts to guide the player toward unlocking the final door. We divided responsibilities among the team based on interest and experience: I focused on scripting major mechanics like the bookshelf and fireplace puzzle, while also integrating everyone’s code into a unified project. Javier designed the environment and puzzle logic, and Jacob set up item interactions and built core functionality like the silver key and chest. Working closely as a team, we were able to teach each other new tools and quickly adapt to the challenges of Unity development.\n\nThis project helped me gain hands-on experience using the full range of Unity’s development tools—from animation and scripting to environment design and interaction systems. It was also a great opportunity to deepen my C# skills and practice building a functional VR experience under a time constraint.",
